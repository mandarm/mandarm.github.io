<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
This algorithm solves the critical section problem for <i>n</i> processes in
software.  The basic idea is that of a bakery; customers take numbers, and
whoever has the lowest number gets service next.  Here, of course, "service"
means entry to the critical section.<p>

<H2>Comments</H2><P>
<i>lines 1-2</i>:
Here, <i>choosing</i>[<i>i</i>] is true if P<sub>i</sub> is choosing a
number.  The number that P<sub>i</sub> will use to enter the critical section is in
<i>number</i>[<i>i</i>]; it is 0 if P<sub>i</sub> is not trying to enter its
critical section.<p>
<i>lines 4-6</i>:
These three lines first indicate that the process is choosing a
number (line 4), then try to assign a unique number to the process P<sub>i</sub> (line 5);
however, that does not always happen.  Afterwards, P<sub>i</sub> indicates it is done
(line 6).<p>
<i>lines 7-12</i>:	Now we select which process goes into the critical section.    Pi
waits until it has the lowest number of all the processes waiting to enter the
critical section. If two processes have the same number, the one with the
smaller name - the value of the subscript - goes in; the notation  "(a,b) &lt;
(c,d)" means true if a &lt; c or if both a = c and b &lt; d (lines 9-10).  Note
that if a process is not trying to enter the critical section, its number is 0.
Also, if a process is choosing a number when P<sub>i</sub> tries to look at it, P<sub>i</sub> waits
until it has done so before looking (line 8).<p>
<i>line 14</i>:	Now P<sub>i</sub> is no longer interested in entering its critical section, so it
sets <i>number</i>[<i>i</i>] to 0.<p>

<H1>Bogus Bakery Algorithm</H1><p>
<H2>Introduction</H2><p>
Why does Lamport's Bakery algorithm used a variable called
<i>choosing</i> (see the algorithm, lines 1, 4, 6, and 8)?  It is very
instructive to see what happens if you leave it out.  This gives an example of
mutual exclusion being violated if you don't put <i>choosing</i> in.
But first, the algorithm (with the lines involving <i>choosing</i>
commented out) so you can see what the modification was:<p>
<H2>Algorithm</H2><p>
<pre>
 1 var (* choosing: shared array [0..n-1] of boolean; *)
 2     number: shared array [0..n-1] of integer;
       ...
 3 repeat
 4     (* choosing[i] := true; *)
 5     number[i] := max(number[0],number[1],...,number[n-1]) + 1;
 6     (* choosing[i] := false; *)
 7     for j := 0 to n-1 do begin
 8         (* while choosing[j] do ; *)
 9         while number[j] &lt;&gt; 0 and 10 (number[j], j) &lt; (number[i],i) do
11             (* nothing *);
12     end;
13     (* critical section *)
14     number[i] := 0;
15     (* remainder section *)
16     until false;

<H2>Proof of Violation of Mutual Exclusion</H2><p>
Suppose we have two processes just beginning; call them p<sub>0</sub> and p<sub>1</sub>.  Both reach
line 5 at the same time.  Now, we'll assume both read <i>number</i>[0]
and <i>number</i>[1] before either addition takes place.  Let p<sub>0</sub>
complete the line, assigning 1 to <i>number</i>[0], but p<sub>1</sub> block
before the assignment.  Then p<sub>0</sub> gets through the <b>while</b> loop at
lines 9-11 and enters the critical section.  It leaves, and attempts re-entry.
It passes line 5, assigning 2 to <i>number</i>[0]; it then goes  into
the critical section, as <i>number</i>[1] is 0.  Now p<sub>1</sub> resumes
execution.  It completes the assignment in line 5; as it read number[0] and
<i>number</i>[1] as 0, it assigns 1 to <i>number</i>[1].  It
then reaches the <b>while</b> loop at lines 9-11, and as
<i>number</i>[0] is 2, it will pass through the <b>while</b>
loop and enter the critical section.  Now both p<sub>0</sub> and p<sub>1</sub> are in the critical
section.<p>
The reason for <i>choosing</i> is to prevent the <b>while
</b>loop in lines 9-11 from being <i>entered</i> when process <i>j</i> is
setting its <i>number</i>[<i>j</i>].  Note that if the loop is entered
and <i>then</i> process <i>j</i> reaches line 5, one of two situations arises.
Either <i>number</i>[<i>j</i>] has the value 0 when the first test is
executed, in which case process <i>i</i> moves on to the next process, or
<i>number</i>[<i>j</i>] has a non-zero value, in which case at some
point <i>number</i>[<i>j</i>] will be greater than
<i>number</i>[<i>i</i>] (since process <i>i</i> finished executing
statement 5 before process <i>j</i> began).  Either way, process <i>i</i> will
enter the critical section before process <i>j</i>, and when process <i>j</i>
reaches the while loop, it will loop at least until process <i>i</i> leaves the
critical section.<p>
